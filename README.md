# A Decentralized Recursive Betting Application

The aim of the game is to be the last person to put Eth into the pot - if you are then you win the entire pot instantly.

Ok - the real aim is to practice coding and thinking about smart contracts and developing (secure) DApps.

## The Smart Contract

The Solidity smart contract that governs the game can be found in the contracts folder as `RecursiveDeposit.sol`. The contract is fairly simple in its implementation of buy ins and payouts.

## The Web Application

The front end is a React App found in the client directory. This is a simple user interface that interacts with web3 to allow the user to buy into the game.
